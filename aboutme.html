 <p>I am Jacob and I am 8 years old. My birthday is on the 18th October. I am from Hong Kong and I live in Tai Po. My favourite subject is English and as you can see, I am using English to make this website. My favourite food is chocolate 🍫 because it is tasty 😋. I like minion 🎥 movies. You can see an article of minions by pressing the “my writings” button. My favourite month is October because it is my birthday 🥳. 
    <br><br> My favourite number is 100 because it means 💯 points in an exam. Anyway, did you know that I got 99.5 points out of 100 in my best English exam? Also, one time, I did not study for an English exam but I got 94 points! 
    <br><br>I also have a YouTube channel. Just press the “my YouTube channel” button, then it will take you to my YouTube channel. (Please press the subscribe button. I need to catch up with my friends because they have 45 subscribers.)
    I also like drawing pictures (you can press the “my drawings” button if you want to see them.) 
    <br><br> If you want to contact me then press the “contact us” button.
